# Running Tests

### Via PyCharm
- Confirm that PyCharm has been configured correctly: project interpreter and environment variables
- Navigate to the `./tests/element_test` file and use the PyCharm UI to run the test
It should pass first time.


### Via Docker

To run the tests inside a container using the image [built here](../../README.md#docker):

```shell
docker run  {the name of the assembled container} pytest 
```
You can specify the flag ``--alluredir='${WORKSPACE}/allure-results'``  to generate a folder with allure-reports.
After that, write a command ``allure serve ./allure-results`` to display the report in the browser window.
